## ABOUT INTERPRETER
This is a basic interpreter made in Python. It's currently still in development, and only supports printing, comments, inputs and variables.

To run a program, open cmd/command prompt and run 'python main.py (path)'

Alternatively, you can replace 'code.baba' with your own program and run main.py without any arguments.
