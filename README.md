## ABOUT INTERPRETER
This is a basic interpreter made in Python. It's currently still in development, and only supports printing and comments.

To load a program, replace 'code.baba' with your own program, then run main.py

Alternatively, you can replace 'code.baba' with your own file in line 5 in main.py

A proper loading system will be implemented when I figure out how to do cool stuff like that.

Yeah, I'm bad at programming sometimes :/

## ABOUT BABA IS PROGRAM
Baba Is Program is an [esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) that is based off of the game [Baba Is You](https://www.hempuli.com/baba/) with syntax mostly based off of Java.

[Here's the Esolang wiki page on it.](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Baba_is_program)
